## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabeshraaj/Search_Algorithms_AI
cd Search_Algorithms_AI
```

### Compile and Run

Each algorithm is implemented in C++. To compile and run an algorithm, use:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

For example, to run the A\* search algorithm:

```bash
g++ a_star.cpp -o a_star
./a_star
```
